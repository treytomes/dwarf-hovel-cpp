# Synopsis

Dwarf Hovel

You picked the short straw, and are the manager of a clan of 13 dwarves.
You're clan has been wandering the underdark for months.  Supplies are low and you don't know the way out.
Morale is low, and your fellow dwarves don't like you all that much.

Good luck on your trip to the surface!
